"""Agent-based evaluator: run real Claude Code agent and score behavior.

GEPA-compatible evaluator that runs a Claude Code instance via the Agent SDK,
captures the full execution trace, and scores using trace-based MLflow judges
with adaptive evaluation criteria plus deterministic trace scorers.

Trace-based judges (using ``{{ trace }}`` template) inspect the actual
execution trace — tool calls, parameters, outputs, errors — and can load
domain-specific evaluation rubrics via ``read_eval_criteria`` /
``read_eval_reference`` tools registered in MLflow's JudgeToolRegistry.

Scoring weights:
  25% Effectiveness delta (WITH vs WITHOUT, per-dimension)
  20% Correctness (trace-based judge: facts, APIs, tool correctness)
  15% Completeness (trace-based judge: task completion, coverage)
  15% Guideline adherence (trace-based judge: patterns, tool selection)
  10% Assertion coverage (deterministic: expected_facts + expected_patterns)
   5% Execution success (deterministic: tool call success ratio)
   5% Token efficiency (deterministic: candidate size)
  -5% Regression penalty (conditional: regression judge)
